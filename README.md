======================

This repository is for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning data course. 

Raw data for this project can be found from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . For this project data set from X_train.txt / X_test.txt was used. In addition to this features.txt was used to label the columns, subject_train.txt / subject_test.txt were used to add test subject and activity_labels.txt was used to give content to activies.

This script assumes that UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted to the same working directory.
